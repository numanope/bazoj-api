# fuckingSlow #

I code in javascript. I'm *flow* coding. I'm not a coding genius.
But I love doing it with the goal of getting the lightest version of the software I'm making.
I also NEED to get my stupid work done by yesterday.
I NEED to get my softthing as nice and light as possible (this is the best I got ü•≤), within the language I'm using and the time I have to learn and search for good tools.

fuckingSlow is a set of libraries (mostly wrappers) with various functionalities, including creating APIs, authentication, cryptographic functions, database connections, and field validation.
Everything is developed using functional and minimalist tools, aiming to be as simple and lightweight as possible and easy (for me) to understand.

I aim to facilitate my own daily personal work with simple wrappers around awesome tools, maybe it helps you too.
It's more of a toolbox with stickers than a hammer.

This toolkit must improve! üõ†Ô∏è

## How do I get set up? ##

Install the specific wanted tool using

```
npm install <package name>
```
and import in the code using

```
import <package name> from '<package name>';
// or
const <local name> = require('<package name>');
```

## Contribution guidelines (I could think of) ##

* Each repository must perform a single task.
* Should work for server, browser, mobile and others where possible and applies.
* Aims for simplicity of use.
* Keep it basic, simple and light.
* Avoid syntactic sugar and fancy shit.
* Exception handling is for exceptions.
* Exception handling should use "try-catch" when possible; otherwise, use "return codes".
* Use a single exit point (only one "return" per function).
* Write the cleanest code possible.
* Use PascalCase for class names. Use camelCase everywhere else.
* Indentation should always be tabs.
* Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.

Also helps:
* Write tests: Contribute by writing tests. (I'm not good at it, yet.)
* Code review: Review and suggest improvements to the code.
* Feel fre to fix what I mess... This is all about improvement. :]
